      <p>We are studying Fitts' Law, a model of human motor response developed by Paul Fitts in 1954. Fitts' Law has been applied by Human Factors and Ergonomics Engineers to thousands of designs ranging from assembly lines to computer interfaces. Since Fitts' model is so influential, it is important to verify its accuracy and to consider alternative models.</p>
      <p>Thank you for participating in our experiment. We are currently not accepting any more testees. The results will be published here in a few months time.</p>
