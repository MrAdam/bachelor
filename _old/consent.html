			<p>There are no foreseeable risks in this study. The personal informations to be collected in the study will not be linkable to individual participants in the study.</p>
			<p>The objective of this study is to gather data about the speed with which humans move to targets of different sizes and at different distances. If you agree to take part in our research, you will be asked to fill out a short, web-based survey, and then click on a series of 33 targets in three separate groups (tasks). In addition to the information you enter in the survet, we will gather data about the time it takes you to select each target.</p>
			<p>All of the information that we obtain from you during the research will be kept confidential. After this reseach is completed, we may save the data for use in future reseach by others or ourselves. However, the same confidentiality guarantees given here will apply to future storage and use of the materials.</p>
